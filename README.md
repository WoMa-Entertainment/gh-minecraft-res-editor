# gh-minecraft-res-editor
The repository for the minecraft resource editor, for easier resource handling, designed for Minecraft GameHelper 1.8.9

This is a tiny tool which is used to add textures and models to new blocks. In addition to that it is capable of editing language files. This program will only work on Windows in combination with GameHelper-Forge-MDK.

# The project has moved! This repository might not get any further updates!
